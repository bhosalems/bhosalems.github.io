I am First year CS PhD student advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RoGOW9AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate' target='_blank'> Dr. David doermann</a>. Prior to this I completed my Masters in CS, aslo at UB and B.Tech at Walchand college of Engineering, Shivaji University, India. I developed deeplearning models for filesystems at Veritas Technologies LLC, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WzjDCkAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate' target='_blank'>Anindya Banerjee</a>.

My current research projects focus on utilizing generetive models to enhance image analysis and interpretation.
